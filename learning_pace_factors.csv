3. Learning Environment: The environment of my  learning, such as distractions, resources available, and study habits, can affect my learning pace and the amount of time dedicating to studying.

4. Learning Style: My preferred learning style, whether visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, can impact how quickly understand the new concepts and how much time needs to spend on each topic.

5. Cognitive Abilities: Individual differences in cognitive abilities, such as memory retention, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking, can influence my learning pace and the time required to master new material.

6. Time Management Skills: My ability to effectively manage my time, set priorities, and create a study schedule can determine how efficiently learn and how much time allocate to studying computer science.

7. Support System: The support system that have in place, such as mentors, peers, or online communities, can provide assistance when needed, potentially speeding up my learning process and reducing the time spent on challenging topics."

My motivation levels greatly impact how much effort I put into learning, as well as my interest in the subject matter. If I find a topic fascinating, I tend to dedicate more time to it naturally. Prior knowledge and experience also play a significant role; if I have a strong foundation in a subject, I can grasp new concepts more quickly. However, if the material is complex or unfamiliar, it might take me longer to understand and absorb it. Additionally, my learning style affects how I engage with the material—whether I prefer visual aids, hands-on activities, or listening to lectures. External distractions, like noise or interruptions, can disrupt my focus and extend my study sessions. Lastly, my personal commitments and schedule influence the amount of time I can allocate to studying each week, sometimes resulting in varying study durations. Overall, finding a balance among these factors is key to optimizing my learning process and achieving my academic goals."

Then there's my prior knowledge and experience in the subject – if it's something I'm familiar with, I can pick it up quicker, but if it's new territory, I'll need to spend more time on it. The way the material is taught also matters; if it's presented in a way that clicks with me, I'll learn faster.

12847,"Several factors influence my learning pace and the time I devote to learning activities. Firstly, the complexity of the material significantly affects how quickly I can grasp concepts and progress through the content. Additionally, my prior knowledge and experience in the subject area play a crucial role in determining the ease with which I can understand new information.

Furthermore, my preferred learning style, whether visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, impacts how effectively I can absorb and retain knowledge. Moreover, my level of engagement and motivation directly influences the amount of time and effort I invest in studying. If I find the material engaging and relevant to my goals, I'm more likely to dedicate ample time to learning.

External responsibilities and commitments, such as academic workload, job obligations, and family responsibilities, also affect the time I can allocate to learning. Balancing these responsibilities requires effective time management skills. Additionally, the learning environment, including factors like noise levels, distractions, and access to resources, can impact my concentration and productivity.

Access to supportive resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and mentorship can enhance my learning experience and facilitate progress. Lastly, regular feedback on my performance and opportunities for self-assessment enable me to gauge my understanding and adjust my learning pace accordingly. Overall, by considering these factors and making necessary adjustments, I can optimize my learning pace and make efficient use of my time as a university computer science student."

Оплата моего труда напрямую связана со временем, потраченным на работу, поэтому я не могу пожертвовать работой в пользу обучения — приходится забирать время от отдыха или сна.  Иногда способность к концентрации ослабевает, и учебу в день приходится пропустить.

— Дедлайны. Для меня сильным мотиватором стала оплата годичных курсов авансом и угроза отчисления за невыполненные задачи. Если я правильно понимаю условия договора, деньги бы вернулись, но я рассудил так: через год у меня все равно не будет этих денег, зато возможно я смогу работать на новой специальности. Этого не произошло, но я понимаю что прошел большой путь по изучению CS. 

— Ответственность перед группой. Во время дипломной работы в Яндекс Практикуме наш поток разделился на группы по 4 человека.

Firstly, the complexity of the topic plays a significant role - more intricate concepts may require additional time and effort to grasp fully. Additionally, the clarity and effectiveness of the learning materials and resources available can impact my learning pace. Practical hands-on experience, such as coding exercises and projects, also helps solidify my understanding and can accelerate the learning process. Furthermore, my prior knowledge and familiarity with related topics can either expedite or slow down my learning pace.

Personal motivation is crucial; when I'm deeply interested in a subject, I tend to learn more quickly and invest more time in it. My learning preferences, whether I'm an auditory, visual, or kinesthetic learner, also impact how fast I understand and retain information. External factors such as the availability of resources, the quality of educational materials, and the clarity of instruction play a role in my learning efficiency. Time management skills, external commitments, and overall workload determine how much time I can allocate to learning. Support systems, like mentors, study groups, or online communities, positively impact my learning pace by providing guidance and motivation. Additionally, setting clear goals and having a structured learning plan helps me stay on track and manage my time effectively. Overall, a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributes to the pace and dedication with which I learn."

Lorsque je suis passionné par un sujet ou un domaine spécifique, je suis plus enclin à y consacrer du temps et des efforts. Ensuite, la disponibilité de ressources d'apprentissage de qualité est cruciale. Des tutoriels bien conçus, des livres instructifs et des cours en ligne bien structurés peuvent stimuler ma progression et mon engagement. De plus, l'environnement dans lequel j'apprends est important. Une atmosphère calme et propice à la concentration favorise une absorption efficace des connaissances.

26913,Relevance to my work
26920,"Several factors influence my learning pace:

Complexity of the Topic: More complex topics inherently require more time and effort to grasp fully. I might spend days on advanced topics, while a simpler concept might only take a few hours.

Prior Knowledge: If I have a decent foundation in a related area, I can typically learn new material faster. Building upon existing knowledge is more efficient than starting from scratch. Vertical integration of related material.

Learning Resources: Quality and format of resources used will impact the time spent learning. Well-structured tutorials, videos, and  exercises tend make learning easy compared to dense books or poorly explained materials.

Motivation and Interest: My level of interest in a topic directly affects motive and the time I'm willing to invest. When I'm genuinely passionate about a subject, I will learn faster and dedicate alot more time to it.

External Factors: My schedule, workload, and personal commitments will obviously impede the time allocated to learning. Some days I might have lots of free time. Other days; not as much.

Learning Style: I learn best through a combination of hands-on practice, visual aids, and theoretical explanations. Finding resources that cater to my learning style is most beneficial

Mental and Physical State: Fatigue, stress, and distractions can significantly hinder my learning pace. When I'm well-rested, focused, and in a positive mindset, I learn more effectively and efficiently.

To manage my engagement and time effectively, I try to:

Set realistic goals: Breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable chunks and set reasonable goals.

Prioritize: I focus on the most important or interesting topics first

Vary learning methods: I switch to different types of resources (tutorials, videos, coding exercises) to keep myself engaged and avoid burnout

Create a positive learning environment:  Minimize distractions, make sure I have a comfortable workspace, and take breaks to avoid mental fatigue
